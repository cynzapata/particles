# Three.js Journey
This project showcases my understanding of particles and animating particles in a Three.js scene.
I utilized Three.js, Node.js, Vercel, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to make a cluster of particles that mimic the movement of a wave.
I followed Bruno Simon's tutorial to understand how to load textures, gui controls, lights, create objects, and animation in Three.js
